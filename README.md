# ModernPortfolio-Neniemsu

This was my first portfolio Site project after that on codepen that is. I followed the instructions from Travacy Media to make this and i really loved making it.

Currently live on www.neniemsu.com

### What i learned during this project

1. Got to use Sass and to implement the use of npm to initialize and compile css with the use of the command line.
2. Made scss variables and a basic for loop.
